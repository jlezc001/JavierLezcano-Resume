        <p class="lead mb-4"> I began working in retail at Sears and Roebuck Co. in the fall of 2018 as a sales associate in the men's department. 
        My job consisted of making sure Sears was the store customers went to for the amazing customer service, such as welcoming and helping people when needed.
        Additionally, I had to make sure the men's department was always clean, organized as well as up to date with the latest trends with clothing from our 
        vast inventory. Another key component of being a sales associate at sears, consisted of trying to sign up people for our rewards program that came with a credit card. 
        I had to make sure the application process went smoothly for the customers in order for them to utilize this card on the same day for unlimited benefits and rewards. 
        I was also in charge of folding and restocking clothes, accessories and shoes throughout the different areas of the store in order to make it accessible and fast for the customers. 
         <br><br>

        In the fall of 2019, I was offered the position of AVID Tutor at Poly High School after my old AVID teacher saw potential in me of spreading the AVID message to the up and coming classes of students 
        in the district. As an AVID Tutor, my job conists of grading students organizational and note-taking skills as well as tutor them on a variety of high school subjects 
        on a daily basis. The tutor's specific job consists of grading their weekly notes that they must take for all of their classes as well as their binders that they muts 
        keep organized and well kept throughout the week. In addition, they turn in tutorial forms where they show problems that they have difficult, but must show us tutors that they 
        attempted such problem and know what is happening. An important goal that the program emphasizes is that students continue their education after high school and go to a community 
        college or a four-year university, which so far all AVID students have been able to follow through with. The tutors must also encourage these students to follow their dream schools 
        and help them with their application process into college as well as with FAFSA and scholarships. With the COVID-19 pandemic however, our jobs as tutors has shifted quite a bit, since we must take into consideration the difficulty that 
        some students may be facing throughout these harsh times. Now more than ever, we encourage tutoring sessions to also be a safe place for students to talk about their day and how they 
        are doing mentally. Even though some of our students have had obstacles throughout thie virtual transition, AVID has been able to help plenty of students stay on track for graduation as
        well as attending a college or university. In the AVID program, we take pride in the connection that us the staff is able to create with the students, since they come to us for help 
        whenever they need it and in turn they achieve a higher rate of success throughout their high school career and college career. <br><br>
